Abstract

This study explores the creation of cohorts of songs based on various audio features using machine learning techniques. The study aims to identify patterns and groupings within a dataset of songs, potentially uncovering insights into musical preferences and genre classifications.

Executive Summary

The project analyzes a dataset of songs using K-means clustering to create cohorts based on audio features. The process involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of unsupervised learning techniques. The resulting clusters provide insights into song similarities and potential genre classifications.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values and scaling features.

Feature Selection: Key audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and tempo were selected for clustering.

K-means Clustering: The K-means algorithm was applied to group songs into cohorts based on their audio features.

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization purposes.

Visualization: The resulting clusters were visualized using scatter plots to identify patterns and groupings.

Model Accuracy and Measures

As K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, traditional accuracy measures are not applicable. However, the model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) and silhouette score.

Model Reliability

The reliability of the model depends on several factors:

Feature Selection: The chosen audio features should adequately represent the characteristics of the songs.

Number of Clusters: The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, which helps in finding a balance between model complexity and performance.

Reproducibility: The K-means algorithm was initialized multiple times to ensure consistent results.

Conclusions

The K-means clustering algorithm successfully created cohorts of songs based on their audio features.

Visualizations revealed distinct groupings of songs, suggesting potential genre classifications or similarity in musical characteristics[1].

The PCA-reduced feature space allowed for effective visualization of high-dimensional data.

Recommendations

Genre Classification: Use the created cohorts as a basis for developing a genre classification system.

Playlist Generation: Leverage the clustering results to create personalized playlists or recommend similar songs to users.

Feature Importance: Analyze the importance of different audio features in determining song similarities.

Further Study

Alternative Clustering Algorithms: Explore other clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN to compare results.

Temporal Analysis: Investigate how song cohorts change over time by incorporating release date information.

Lyrical Analysis: Integrate natural language processing techniques to analyze song lyrics alongside audio features.

User Preferences: Combine clustering results with user listening data to improve music recommendation systems.
